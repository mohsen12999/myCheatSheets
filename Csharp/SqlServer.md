# Sql Server

## Drop All Table

* Select `Tables` on the database tree (Object Explorer)
* Press `F7` to open Object Explorer Details view
* In this view select tables which have to be deleted (in this case all of them)
* Press Delete until all tables are deleted (you repeat it as many times as amount of errors due to key constraints/dependencies)
