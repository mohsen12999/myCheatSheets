# SOLID

- Single Responsibility Principle
- Open-Closed Principle
- Liskov Substitution Principle
- Interface Segregation Principle
- Dependency Inversion Principle

## Single Responsibility Principle

- a class should do one thing and therefore it should have only a single reason to change.

## Open-Closed Principle

- classes should be open for extension and closed to modification.

## Liskov Substitution Principle

- subclasses should be substitutable for their base classes.

## Interface Segregation Principle

- Segregation means keeping things separated, and the Interface Segregation Principle is about separating the interfaces.

## Dependency Inversion Principle

- our classes should depend upon interfaces or abstract classes instead of concrete classes and functions.
