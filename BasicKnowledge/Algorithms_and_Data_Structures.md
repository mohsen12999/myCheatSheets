# Algorithms and Data Structures

## Algorithm

### definition

in general: A set of steps or instructions for completing task.
in programs: A set of steps a program takes to finish a task.

### Features

- Clearly defined problem statement, input, and output.
- The steps in the algorithm need to be in a very specific order.
- The step also need to be distinct.
- The algorithm should product a result.
- The algorithm should complete in finite amount of time.

two measure for Algorithm:

- Correctness
- Efficiency
  - Time Complexity
  - Space Complexity

## Time Complexity

### Big O

Theoretical definition of the complexity of an algorithm as a function of the size.
Order of magnitude of complexity

- Constant time: O(1)
- Linear Search: O(n)
- Binary Search: O(log n) -> known as subLinear
- Quadratic Time: O(n ^ 2)
- Cubic Runtime: O(n ^ 3)
- QuasiLinear Runtime: O(n log n) -> like merge sort
- Polynomial Runtime: O(n^k) -> k is constant number

any algorithm under Polynomial runtime consider efficient and likely to be use in practice.

- Exponential Runtime: O(X ^ n) -> brute force for password
- Combinatorial: O(n!) -> Traveling Salesman
